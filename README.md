## Features

- Create conventional commits with ease
- Help contributors do the same without them having to know how to write one
- Use emoji with your commit types if you'd like ðŸ‘‹
- ~~Run as a git hook~~ ([soon](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/issues/2))
- A single binary so you don't need to bring along a whole other ecosystem to your project

## Installation

Check the [releases](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/releases) page to download koji for your platform.

This will soon enough be made easier with [webinstall.dev](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/issues/10).

## Usage

### Using koji

```bash
# Do some work
cd dev/work-stuff
git add .env.production

# Create a conventional commit
koji
```

### Fancy it up with emoji

Passing `-e` or `--emoji` to `koji` will prepend your commit message
with an emoji related to the commit type. The default emoji can be seen
[here](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/blob/main/meta/config/koji-default.toml).

### Add custom commit types

You can add custom commit types via a `koji.toml` file in the working directory.
Some examples can be found [here](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/blob/main/meta/config).
