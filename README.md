## Features

- Create conventional commits with ease & help contributors do
the same without them having to know how to write one
- A single binary so you don't need to bring along a whole other ecosystem to your project
- [Run as a git hook](#as-a-git-hook)
- [Use emoji](#with-emoji) ðŸ‘‹
- [Use custom commit types](#use-custom-commit-types)

## Installation

Check the [releases](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/releases) page to download koji for your platform.

This will soon enough be made easier with [webinstall.dev](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/issues/10).

## Usage

### Using koji

```bash
# Do some work
cd dev/work-stuff
git add .env.production

# Create a conventional commit
koji
```

### As a git hook

If you're using [rusty-hook](https://github.com/swellaby/rusty-hook), set this
in your `.rusty-hook.toml` file.

```toml
prepare-commit-msg = "koji --hook"
```

Similar should work for any hook runner, just make sure you're using
it with the `prepare-commit-msg` hook as it writes the commit
message to `COMMIT_EDITMSG`.

### With emoji

Passing `-e` or `--emoji` to `koji` will prepend your commit message
with an emoji related to the commit type. The default emoji can be seen
[here](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/blob/main/meta/config/koji-default.toml).

### Use custom commit types

You can add custom commit types via a `koji.toml` file in the working directory.
Some examples can be found [here](https://github.com/its-danny/koji/blob/main/meta/config).
